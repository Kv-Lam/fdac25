My name is Vansh Joshi, I am a senior majoring in computer science. I am hoping to get more experience working with data. I have already worked with a large dataset during my internship with UDig taking product images and metadata. I ensured the data was consistent by removing duplicates, handling missing or mislabeled product attributes, and normalizing formats (like units, naming conventions, and IDs). I'm hoping to get little bit more hands on experience making my own project using a large dataset.
